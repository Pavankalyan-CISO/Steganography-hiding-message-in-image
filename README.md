# Steganography-Hiding message in image
This project demonstrates a simple steganography technique for hiding secret messages within an image using Python. The code employs cryptographic hashing, password evaluation, and image manipulation to embed and extract hidden messages securely.

Description:

This Python script facilitates hiding secret messages within an image (like "Kali.jpg") through steganography. It uses cryptographic hashing (SHA-256), password strength evaluation, and OpenCV for image manipulation.


Introduction:

Steganography involves concealing secret information within an ordinary, non-secret, or digital medium, such as an image, audio file, or video. This project focuses on embedding text messages within image files using a password-protected mechanism.

Requirements:

Ensure you have the required libraries installed (hashlib, getpass, warnings, OpenCV, os, string).

Execute the Python script and follow the prompts:

Input the secret message to hide within the image.

Enter a strong password to encrypt and hide the message.

An image file (Encryptedmsg.jpg) will be generated, containing the hidden message.

Use the script to decrypt and retrieve the concealed message.

Features:-

Password Protection: 

Utilizes strong password requirements and cryptographic hashing for enhanced security.

Encryption and Decryption:

Hides and retrieves messages within image files using steganography techniques.

User Interaction:

Offers a simple user interface through terminal prompts for input and interaction.

Security:

The script emphasizes password strength evaluation and employs cryptographic hashing to ensure secure message embedding and retrieval.
